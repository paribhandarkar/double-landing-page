# Double Landing Page

This is a project that demonstrates the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive double landing page. The landing page consists of two split sections, one for Apple and the other for Samsung, each displaying an image and text. The split sections are positioned absolutely and take up 50% of the container's width each.

## Demo

You can try out the application by visiting [this link](https://paribhandarkar.github.io/double-landing-page/).

## Project Overview

The project provides a basic template for building landing pages with interactivity. When the user hovers over the left or right split section, the container element is given the active-left or active-right class, respectively, which modifies the width of the split sections. This provides an interactive experience for the user.

## Technologies Used

## New Things I Learned

I learned about the "mouseenter" and "mouseleave" events in JavaScript. These events are used to detect when the mouse enters or leaves an HTML element. They are commonly used in web development to trigger various actions such as showing or hiding elements, changing the appearance of elements, or modifying the behavior of an element in response to user interaction. These events are important for creating interactive web applications or improving the user experience of a website.
